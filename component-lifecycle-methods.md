**What are the lifecycle methods of React?**

The lifecycle methods of React are methods that are called at specific points during the lifecycle of a component. They include:
  - **`componentDidMount`**: Called after the component has been added to the DOM.
  - **`componentDidUpdate`**: Called after the component has been updated.
  - **`componentWillUnmount`**: Called before the component is removed from the DOM.
  - **`render`**: Called whenever the component needs to update the DOM.
  - **`constructor`**: Called before the component is added to the DOM.
