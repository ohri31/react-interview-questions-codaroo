**What is code-splitting in React and why do we use it?**

Code-splitting is a technique that allows you to split your application's JavaScript code into smaller chunks. This can improve the performance of your application by only loading the code that is needed for the current page or component. This technique is usually used in combination with a bundler like webpack.
