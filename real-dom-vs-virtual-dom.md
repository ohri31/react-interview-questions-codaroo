**What are the differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?**
Real DOM is the actual tree-like structure of a web page, which can be manipulated directly to change the layout or content of the page. Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which is used to optimize the performance of updates to the user interface.
