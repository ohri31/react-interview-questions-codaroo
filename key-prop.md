**What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?**

The "key" prop is used to give a unique identifier to each item in an array of elements. When elements are re-rendered, React uses the key to identify which elements have changed, added, or removed. This allows React to update the DOM efficiently, improving the performance of the application.
