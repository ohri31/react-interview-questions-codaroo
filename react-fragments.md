**What are fragments?**

A fragment is a way to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It allows you to return multiple elements from a component's render method without wrapping them in an additional DOM node. Fragments are represented by an empty JSX tag: **`<>`** or **`</>`**
