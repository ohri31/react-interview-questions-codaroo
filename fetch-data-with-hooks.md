**How to fetch data with React Hooks?**

You can use the **`useEffect`** hook to fetch data in a React functional component. The **`useEffect`** hook allows you to run a side effect, such as fetching data, after the component has rendered. You can also use **`useState`** to store the fetched data and update the component when the data is available.
