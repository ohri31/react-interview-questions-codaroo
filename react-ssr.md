**How do you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?**

To implement Server Side Rendering (SSR) in a React application, you can use a library such as Next.js or ReactDOMServer. These libraries allow you to render your React components on the server and send the resulting HTML to the browser. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial load time and providing a better experience for search engines.
