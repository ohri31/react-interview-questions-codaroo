**Why fragments are better than container divs?**

Fragments are better than container divs because they don't add an extra node to the DOM. This can make the rendered HTML cleaner and more efficient, especially when you have a component that renders a list of items. Additionally, it helps with accessibility because it doesn't create an unnecessary wrapper element around the content.
