**What is the difference between React context and React Redux?**

React context is a built-in feature of React that allows you to share data between components without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree. React Redux is a library that allows you to connect your React components to a Redux store. It provides a way to access the state from the store and to dispatch actions to modify the state.
