**What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?**

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a way to build reusable UI components and manage their state. ReactDOM is a separate library that provides specific methods for interacting with the DOM, such as **`render()`** and **`unmountComponentAtNode()`**. ReactDOM is the glue that connects React with the DOM.
