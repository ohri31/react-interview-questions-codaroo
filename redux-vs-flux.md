**What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?**

The downsides of Redux compared to Flux are:
  - The learning curve is steeper as it has a lot more concepts
  - It can create unnecessary complexity for small or simple applications
  - It can make debugging more difficult because the state is not visible in the components
  - It can lead to verbose and repetitive code because actions and action creators are separate files
