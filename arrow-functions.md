**Is it good to use arrow functions in render methods?**

It's generally not good to use arrow functions in the render method because they create a new function on every render, which can negatively impact performance. If a component uses an arrow function in its render method, it will re-create that function on every render and cause the component to re-render even if its props haven't changed.
