**What are forward refs and can you give me a code example for it?**

A forward ref is a way to pass a ref through a component to a child component. It allows you to access the ref of a child component from the parent component. Here's an example of how to create a forward ref:

```
import React from 'react';

const MyInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={ref} />
    </div>
  );
});

function App() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();

  const handleClick = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

export default App;
In this example, we created a component MyInput that accepts a ref through its props and then passed that ref to an input element. In the parent component, we created a ref with useRef hook and then passed it to the MyInput component through the ref prop. When the button is clicked, the handleClick function is executed, which focuses on the input element by accessing it through the inputRef ref.
