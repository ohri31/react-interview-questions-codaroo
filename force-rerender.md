**Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?**

You can force a component to re-render without calling setState by changing its key prop. This will cause React to treat the component as a new one and it will re-render it. This can be useful in some cases, but it's generally not recommended because it can cause unnecessary re-renders and negatively impact performance.
