**What are error boundaries in React v16?**

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. They were introduced in React v16, and they allow you to handle errors gracefully and ensure that your application continues to function even if there is an error.
