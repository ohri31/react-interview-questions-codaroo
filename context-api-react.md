**What is the Context API in React?**

The Context API in React allows you to share data between components without passing props through every level of the component tree. It provides a way for components to access data that is "global" to the component tree, such as a user's authentication status or a theme. The Context API consists of a Provider component, which provides the data, and a Consumer component, which accesses the data.
